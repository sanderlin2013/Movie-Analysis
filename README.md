# Analyzing the Money: The Magic Behind The Movies

**Author**: [Rachel Sanderlin](mailto:sanderlin2013@gmail.com)

## Overview
In this project, we will be looking at movie datasets in order to give recommendations to Microsoft's new movie studio.

Entertainment is a huge, global market. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosaescandon/2020/03/12/the-film-industry-made-a-record-breaking-100-billion-last-year/?sh=5404bc6634cd), the film industry made over 100 billion dollars in 2019. While that is a significant chunk of change, there is also a significant overhead in creating entertainment content. It is important for fledgling movie studios to research what type of content does well, so that they can use information from previous successes as a guide to replicate that success. As Microsoft is interested in making movies, the following project will focus on that component of the entertainment industry.

## Business Problem
While movies can be highly profitable, they are often expensive to produce. As such, it is important for Microsoft to look into what does- or does not- lead to financially successful movies. Analyzing movie success is complex, so this project has choosen a few elements to focus on. 

### Business Questions
The specific questions that this project focuses on are as follows: 
-Do certain genres result in higher grossing films?
-Is there a relationship between specific actors and higher grossing films?
-Do movies with higher average ratings result in higher grossing films?

## Data 
In order to glean information relevant to movie-making we will be looking at two datasets from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) and [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/). 

- IMDB stands for Internet Movie Database and is one of the most popular and comprehensive internet sources for movie and entertainment data. The dataset we are working with focuses on information about movies - the producers, the genres, the actors, the movies ratings, ect. 

- Box Office Mojo is a site that tracks box-office revenue, and the data set we will be using from them contains this information. 

By using these two datasets together, we can extract if certain aspects of a movie lead to higher box-office revenue, which is an industry standard for movie success. 

**Limitations** 

This data is only on movies, thus it can not be extrapolated to the entire entertainment industry. Additionally, as the dataset only contains the total gross, it will not include the costs of creating the movies. Finally, the dataset only looks at box office revenue, which means that the total revenue (from streaming sites or other sources) may be higher. 

## Method
This project uses descriptive analysis in order to find useful movie industry business recommendations.
